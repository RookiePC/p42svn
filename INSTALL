Installation Instructions
-------------------------

Requirements:

* Perl -- most Unix/Linux systems should have this already, otherwise,
  go to http://www.perl.com/

* Perforce Perl API
  You can find this at http://www.perforce.com/perforce/loadsupp.html#api.
  Instructions at
  http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/user/p4perlnotess.txt

* Perforce C/C++ API
  In order to build the Perforce Perl API, you will also need this.
  See http://www.perforce.com/perforce/loadsupp.html#api

The "install" target in the makefile should install the latter two
items and the p42svn scripts.
* The variable PREFIX controls where to install the p42svn
  scripts (the p4perl api will get installed with perl).
* The variable P4VER controls what version of the P4 api to
build against, it must match the directory name on the Perforce ftp
site.  For example:

 make install PREFIX=/scratch P4VER=r12.4

If anybody wants to contribute instructions for Windows, that would be helpful.

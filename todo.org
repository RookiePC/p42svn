   It seems p42svn takes the dates from P4 as utc
   sample depot
   Change 12000 by perfmerge++@perfmerge++ on 2011/05/16 15:03:40
   in dump file:
   Revision-number: 462
   2011-05-16T15:03:40.000000Z
   p4_get_change_details() is where this needs to be adjusted
   add "utc" to time2str, otherwise it uses local time
   testcase in timezone.t
** DONE non utf8 chars in log messages
   An attempt at this was done in svn_props2string()
   but I couldn't get the byte counts right
   Rajesh's patch fixes this
** DONE case insensitivity in depot names:  //doc vs //Doc

   - State "DONE"       from "BUG"        [2012-04-11 Wed 10:28]
   only an issue on case insensitive servers
   both labels and branches need to do this
   Added code in p4_get_label_files() and is_wanted_file()
   which does case insensitive matches if --fix-case is used
** DONE case mapping support with --changes
   CLOSED: [2012-04-11 Wed 10:28]
   - State "DONE"       from "BUG"        [2012-04-11 Wed 10:28]
   refactor casemapping code and use it to process the --existing-files list   
** DONE ETA calculations wrong on incremental imports

** TODO Improve --verify
   check files changed in each rev
   Update:  this has been implemented, but I'm not sure it's 100% right
   only checks for changes, not file contents... that would be as slow as a migration!
   should add properties to repository for verified revs
** TODO Add better statistics
   count revs, actions, content (+cache)
** DONE Fix handling of unintelligible characters
   % escapes was a bad idea
   Perhaps use the new option to encode which takes a code ref for dealing
   with bogus chars... but that requires Perl 5.8.8 or newer
   use an = escape, a la quoted-printable encoding
** TODO Better die() handling
   http://p42svn.tigris.org/ds/viewMessage.do?dsMessageId=2918677&dsForumId=4895
** DONE provide a way to stop p42svn and p42svnsync cleanly
   CLOSED: [2013-01-02 Wed 12:35]

   p42svn should accept a signal telling it to exit after finishing this rev.
   Should be done for INT, HUP, ??
   p42svnsync should pass that signal to p42svn and wait for them to finish.
   should multiple interupts kill it anyway, or just make them do a kill -9?
   decided to use a marker file with the PID on it (by default)
   p42svnsync now tries to deal with INT and HUP by killing svnadmin first.
** BUG panic: sv_setpvn
   User report:
   I had trouble getting past “panic: sv_setpvn called with negative
   strlen” when it was running the line:
   “$result = $p4->Run('print',$filename);”,
   so I simply replaced the line with direct invocation of
   “p4 print –q $filename” and all seemed fine.
   
   Do you have reason to believe that doing so is not identical to doing
   “Run(‘print’, $filename)” ?

   FYI the below is the related thread that someone else started where I provided my own input:
   http://forums.perforce.com/index.php?/topic/756-p4perlc-api-issues-with-run/page__gopid__4142#entry4142

** SOMEDAY optimize branch, integrate and label to copy entire tree
   for example a branch action will list every file in the tree
   but in svn that can be a copy of the top of the tree
   Not sure if this is even possible with the data at hand:
   the branch change list is based on the versions (#) not change numbers (@)
   So I don't know if there's any way to determine which change a given
   branch or label is without doing even more queries against P4, which
   is where the performance suffers.
** TODO fail on outside scope copies
   if the origin of a label, branch or integrate is not within scope,
   it is blindly turned into a copy.
   however, it is possible that these are signs of bad set of branch specs
   so, should we issue warnings, or maybe error out given a cmd line option?
** Test suite
*** TODO Set up a self contained depot instead of the stock sample file
    needs to be a case insensitive server
    check in the checkpointed tar ball
*** DONE finish converting test cases to perl-based tests
    CLOSED: [2013-01-02 Wed 15:57]
    - State "DONE"       from "NEXT"       [2013-01-02 Wed 15:57]
*** TODO Verify that conversion test is correct
    that is, changing file types, like link replaced with a dir, &c.
    Could someone who knows P4 review?
*** TODO test cases for case insensitivity
    how to set up test cases, another depot with -C1?
    or switch existing server?
*** TODO test cases for weird characters
    is rawcharset.t sufficient?
*** TODO test case for integrating from other depots, including removed ones
*** TODO test case for purge
*** TODO more test cases for move operations
    currently the assumption is that move/add and move/delete operations will
    occur together in a given changeset, and than simply doing the former
    before the latter will ensure the operations get converted properly.
    Is this assumption wrong
*** TODO test cases for labels
    labels can show delete, move/delete and purge operations.
    these get excluded at conversion time.
    the test depot has no such labels... how do they get generated?

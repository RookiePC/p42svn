This is the test suite for p42svn.

Everything is driven by the Makefile, which requires GNU Make, and
there are some hardwired Linux bits in there (for now).

Initially, everything, even test cases, were simply encoded in the Makefile.
This was too arcane and didn't produce a nice test summary.  So, new tests
are being written in Perl using the Test module, and then the make target
"ptest" uses Perl and Test::Harness to run all the tests.  Eventually, all
tests will be rewritten into Perl, and all that will be left in the Makefile
are the bits to set up the sample depot.

The makefile will fetch p4, p4d and the sample depot from Perforce,
and start up a server on the default port (1666) if you want a
different port redefine PORTNUM on the command line (every time you
call make).

If you want a command line with env vars set for the test depot,
run "make shell" (after the depot has been set up, of course).

I am certain this test suite only scratches at the surface of what needs
testing, but it's a start.

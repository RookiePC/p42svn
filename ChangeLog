Version 0.31 2013-01-??  Trent Fisher <trentf@tigris.org>

	* Fixed the ETA calculations for incremental imports

	* Added more documentation on labels.

	* Fixed the handling of labels on move/delete and purge files
	I don't know how this can happen yet, so I could use a hand
	building a test case.

Version 0.30 2013-01-11  Trent Fisher <trentf@tigris.org>

	* Added makefiles to automate several tasks, including installation
	Though, it has only been tested on Linux.  YMMV.

	* p42svnsync: A utility to do continuous synchronization between
	a Perforce depot and Subversion, much like svnsync.
	This depends on many new features listed below.

	* Labels: added support for migrating labels via the --label option.
	Initially derived from a patch from Sheridan Rawlins

	* Added options --existing-files and --existing-revs
	to fix issues with incremental imports.

	* Added code to deal with Windows servers which are case-inconsistent.
	See the --fix-case option

	* Added an option to save the Perforce change numbers in SVN.
	See the --save-changenum option.

	* Added code to deal with non utf8 filenames.
	See the --rawcharset option.

	* Added option to make p42svn stop gracefully after processing
	the current changeset/revision. See the --stopfile option.

	* Added an option to skip over versions which are corrupted in
	Perforce.  See the --skipcorrupt option.

	* Added an option to make fatal errors drop the error into the dump
	stream, which should cause svnadmin load to fail, rather than
	commit an incomplete revision.  Useful when piping directly
	into svnadmin load. See the --nopartialrev option.

	* Added a rudimentary --verify option (right now it just verifies
	that each p4 rev has a matching one in subversion.

	* Modified the P4 connection code to keep the connection to the
	server open.  This can speed up conversions significantly.
	Patch supplied by Rajesh (full name not given).

	* Added an code to cache file contents locally in an attempt to speed
	up repeated import attempts. See the --contentcache option.

	* Reworked routine for fetching file contents to avoid using fork
	and sending the entire file contents on the stack, which will exhaust
	memory for very large files.  This may also make it easier to run on
	Windows, but I've made no attempt to test this.

	* Added code to deal with the types of "files" changing,
	symlink to file, etc.

	* Added a rudimentary test suite.

	* Add support for move/delete and move/add actions.
	From a patch by Alex Java

	* Fixed the purge action to do something reasonable.

	* Modified code to deal with very old versions Perforce.

	* Added better progress indicators with -v option.

Version 0.21 2009-05-01  Dimitri Papadopoulos-Orfanos  <dpo@tigris.org>

	* Update documentation.

	* By default do not convert Perforce keywords.

	* Avoid warning: do not pass uninitialized variables to debug().

	* Initial support for Perforce purge action. Not tested!

	* Avoid calculating MD5 and properties in svn_add_copy() and
	  svn_replace_copy(). This speeds up conversion.

	* Merge code from:
	  svn_add_symlink() and svn_add_file()
	  svn_edit_symlink() and svn_edit_symlink()

	* Fix is_in_range() to properly test against ranges of changelists
	  specified arguments by option '--changes'.

	* Properly handle changes falling outside of changes specified
	  by option '--changes' in p4_file2svnrev().

	* Consistent error messages.

	* Depending on the version of Perforce, Run('diff2') might return
	  an ARRAY or a HASH. Apply strict tests to the return value.
	  This fixes p4_files_are_identical() which was totally broken
	  under recent versions of Perforce.
	  It looks like very old versions of Perforce might return a SCALAR
	  but this will not be supported anymore.

	* Comply with the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) 2.3 which
	  seems to expect a "magic.mime" file in "/usr/share/file".

	* Add the '-s' option to Run('describe', ...) to exclude the diffs
	  and speed up transfer.

	* Get rid of "pseudo hashes" deprecated as of Perl 5.8.0.

	* Perforce P4Perl is significantly different from the P4Perl on
	  Tony Smith's page. Detect the version of P4Perl and adapt to
	  the API of either version:
	     ParseForms() ->
	     Changes(...) -> Run('changes', ...)
	    Describe(...) -> Run('describe', ...)
	       Print(...) -> Run('print', ...)
	       Diff2(...) -> Run('diff2', ...)
	     Filelog(...) -> Run('filelog', ...)

	* Get rid of obsolete methods Init() and Final().

	* When SetVersion() is available, specify the version of p42svn.

Version 0.20 2007-07-01  Dimitri Papadopoulos-Orfanos  <dpo@tigris.org>

	* Accept all changes when no range is specififed.

Version 0.19 2007-06-14  Dimitri Papadopoulos-Orfanos  <dpo@tigris.org>

	* Option '--changes' limits the range of dumped  changelists.

	* When adding parent directories, don't add root ("/").

	* Option '--dry-run' -  avoids downloading large files from the
	  Perforce server. This allows you to quickly preflight to make
	  sure everything will be successful.

	* Option '--verbose' for verbose output - without the overwhelming
	  output of '--debug'. 

	* Tolerance for corrupt changelists.

Version 0.18 2007-04-16  Dimitri Papadopoulos-Orfanos  <dpo@tigris.org>

	* Option to override $P4CHARSET and select an alternative charset
	  for the Subversion dump/load format.

Version 0.17 2006-03-13  Dimitri Papadopoulos-Orfanos  <dpo@tigris.org>

	* Use new function p4_has_text_flag which tests for text/unicode
	  instead of explicitly testing for text only.

	* Set svn:executable to "on" instead of "1" as it seems more common.

	* Add option to set svn:eol-type for text/unicode Perforce file types.

	* Handle all the Perforce file types listed by 'p4 help filetypes'.

	* Special characters @, #, *, % are now handled by Perforce 2004.2.

	* More support for symlinks, handle edits in addition to adds.

	* Add -w to better detect Perl errors.

Version 0.16 2006-01-23  Ray Miller  <ray@sysdev.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Trim trailing newline from $content when adding a symlink

	* Note tested against P4 version 3.4804 built against 2005.2 of the
	Perforce API.

	These patches thanks to Dimitri Papadopoulos-Orfanos <dpo@tigris.org>.
	
Version 0.15 2006-01-20  Ray Miller  <ray@sysdev.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Improved handling of return from P4::Errors.

	* Added support for symlinks.

	These patches thanks to Dimitri Papadopoulos-Orfanos <dpo@tigris.org>.

Version 0.14 2004/10/20 20:09:46  Ray Miller  <ray@sysdev.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Set binmode on STDOUT to prevent line-end munging under Cygwin's
	Perl.  Bug reported by Damien McKenna <dmckenna@thelimucompany.com>.

Version 0.13 2003/11/06 11:22:21  Ray Miller  <ray@sysdev.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Fix regular expression in munge_keywords() so that Perl variable
	names aren't inadvertently caught.
	
Version 0.12 2003/09/16 15:49:34  Ray Miller  <ray@sysdev.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Yet more special-casing in p4_get_copyfrom_filerev() to handle
	strange Perforce branch/integrate operations.
	
Version 0.11 2003/09/16 11:42:44  Ray Miller  <ray@sysdev.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* More bugfixes to p4_get_copyfrom_filerev(): if return from P4
	Filelog is not of the expected form (so we can't determine the
	source of the branch/integrate), return undef.  The calling
	functions will handle this and treat the branch/integrate as an
	add/edit instead.
	
Version 0.10 2003/09/16 10:11:05  Ray Miller  <ray@sysdev.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Cater for branch/integrate operation where source of
	branch/integrate is not known to Perforce.  (I guess might happen
	as the result of a p4 obliterate.)

Version 0.09 2003/09/12 10:25:00  Ray Miller  <ray@sysdev.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Fix bug in svn_change_copy - node action should be "replace",
	not "change".  Rename function to svn_replace_copy to reflect this.
	Bug reported by Sebastian Rahtz	<sebastian.rahtz@oucs.ox.ac.uk>.

Version 0.08 2003/09/11 17:18:05  Ray Miller  <ray@sysdev.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add option to delete empty parent directories.

Version 0.07 2003/09/10 18:51:53  Ray Miller  <ray@sysdev.oucs.ox.ac.uk>

	* Fix bug in p4_get_copyfrom_filerev - order of depot files
	returned by P4 Filelog is arbitrary, so we have to parse output to
	determine which depot file was actually the source of the
	branch/integrate.

	* Update my email address.
	
Version 0.06 2003/09/03 16:51:06  Ray Miller  <raym@herald.ox.ac.uk>

	* Fix bug in p4branch2svn - treat as add (rather than copy)
	when source and destination file contents differ.  This is almost
	exactly the same problem as was fixed in p4integrate2svn in
	version 0.04.
	
Version 0.05 2003/09/03 15:46:02  Ray Miller  <raym@herald.ox.ac.uk>

	* When the source of a Perforce branch/integrate operation lies
	outside of the branches being processed, treat as add/edit
	instead.
	
Version 0.04 2003/08/26 09:45:44  Ray Miller  <raym@herald.ox.ac.uk>

	* Fix bug in p4integrate2svn - treat as edit (rather than copy)
	when source and destination file contents differ.  Bug reported by
	Garrett Rooney <rooneg@electricjellyfish.net>.
	
Version 0.03 2003/08/06 14:13:19  Ray Miller  <raym@herald.ox.ac.uk>

	* Add support for setting svn:mime-type property.
	
Version 0.02 2003/08/04 22:17:33  Ray Miller  <raym@herald.ox.ac.uk>

	* Fix bug in p4_get_copyfrom_filerev - we should be taking the
	first element from the array, not the last.

	* Die when we can't map a depot file to Subversion path - this
	could happen when depot2svnpath is called with the source of an
	integrate lying outside a branch being processed.

Version 0.01 2003/08/04 18:47:09  Ray Miller  <raym@herald.ox.ac.uk>

	* Initial release.

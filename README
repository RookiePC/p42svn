p42svn is a Perl script to migrate revision history from a Perforce depot to a
Subversion repository.

Ray Miller, the original author of p42svn does not have time to maintain the project
anymore. It was moved to tigris.org where it was managed by Dimitri
Papadopoulos-Orfanos until 2013 when Trent Fisher took over.  The project was
moved to GitHub in 2020 after tigris.org vanished (which means all history was lost).


Requirements

Perl
 Since p42svn is a Perl script, it needs Perl to run. On Linux and many recent Unix
 releases, Perl is already installed. 
Perforce Perl API
 The Perforce Perl API (P4Perl) is usually not distributed with Perl and needs to
 be installed separately. Download and follow the instructions in the release
 notes. 
Perforce C/C++ API
 In order to build the Perforce Perl API, you will also need the Perforce C/C++ API
 (P4API). 

Documentation

There is a migration guide in the www directory, and the two programs
p42svn and p42svnsync have pod documentation which can be seen via
perldoc or pod2html.

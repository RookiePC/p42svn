<h1><a name="how_to_migrate_from_perforce_to_subversion">How to Migrate from Perforce to Subversion</a></h1>
<p>This document provides a general guide for how to migrate from
Perforce to Subversion.  This assumes that a team is actively using
Perforce and that they want as little downtime as possible.  Therefore
it is assumed you will use the new <em>p42svnsync</em> script, but you will
also need to look at the options in <em>p42svn.pl</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Get access to the server.  The user you use must have full access to all files.</p>
<p>This information will be used for the --port, --user and --password options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check if the server is running in case insensitive mode.  This is
usually the case with Windows servers, but may also be true if the
option -C1 is given to p4d.</p>
<p>This will determine what --fix-case option you want to use.  There are
downsides to every option here.  Pick the one that hurts least.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check what character sets may be in use for filenames.  If you have
Windows users, cp1252 is quite likely.</p>
<p>This will be given to --rawcharset option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gather a list of depots.  Determine which ones will be migrated and
into which repositories.  If the depots are generally standalone, you
may want each to go to a different Subversion repository, but if there
is a lot of branching and merging between depots, it may be best to
keep it all in one.</p>
<p>This will determine the --branch option(s) you will use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider other options you may want to use: --save-changenum both is
highly recommended.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create Subversion repositories as needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up replication with p42svnsync, with all the options you have
gathered so far.</p>
<pre>
 p42svnsync init svn-repos --branch //depot/project1=project1</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run replication.  This can run for a VERY long time (I had one depot
take two months), so redirect the output</p>
<pre>
 p42svnsync sync svn-repos -v &gt; svn-repos 2&gt;&amp;1 &amp;</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Monitor progress.  Be patient, very, very patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the process fails, figure out why.  Likely reasons are either that
permissions were wrong, a file is corrupted (either fix it or add
--skipcorrupt), a different character set is in use.</p>
<p>You may be able to just add the new options, like so:</p>
<pre>
 p42svnsync init svn-repos [... options given before ...] --skipcorrupt
 
Then restart the sync, or, worst case, start over.</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the sync is finished, run some verification.  The following would
provide a very basic level of verification:</p>
<pre>
 p42svnsync verify svn-repos</pre>
<p>It is a good idea to do direct comparisons by checking out selected
versions/labels/branches from both Subversion and Perforce and run
diff between them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once you're confident of this, ask engineers to do some verification
of their own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you want to switch your Subversion &quot;replica&quot; into a production
repository, you should remove the replication information:</p>
<pre>
 p42svnsync uninit svn-repos</pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lock up the Perforce depot and tell people to use the Subversion repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>???</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Profit!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<h2><a name="branch_by_branch_migration">Branch by Branch Migration</a></h2>
<p>The above process assumes you are switching over by whole depots.
If the team wants to migrate branch by branch you should set up the
--branch options so that changes from Perforce are dropped into a
single directory.  For example:</p>
<pre>
 p42svnsync init svn-repos --branch //depot/project1=fromp4 ...</pre>
<p>Then ensure that the import directory is protected (via authz or a hook).</p>
<p>Remove the start-commit hook, so people can check into the rest of the
repository.</p>
<p>Once everything has migrated, teams can switch over branch by branch
by copying the branch from the import directory to the usual
Subversion location.  For example:</p>
<pre>
 svn cp <a href="http://svn-server.example.com/svn/svn-repos/fromp4/rel-1.0">http://svn-server.example.com/svn/svn-repos/fromp4/rel-1.0</a>
        <a href="http://svn-server.example.com/svn/svn-repos/branches/rel-1.0">http://svn-server.example.com/svn/svn-repos/branches/rel-1.0</a></pre>
<p>Then development can proceed on the branch just created.  Make sure to
lock up that branch in Perforce to prevent confusion.</p>
<p>Repeat until all branches have migrated.</p>
